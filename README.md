# bookerrata
This is the issues and errata for the "Software Defined Radio for Engineers" book

If you think you found an issue (from techincial, to spelling, to gramar), or want to improve clarity - this is the place to discuss those sorts of issues. Please have a [look](https://github.com/sdrforengineers/bookerrata/issues) to see if it has been discussed before, and if not, post a new [issue](https://github.com/sdrforengineers/bookerrata/issues/new).

As issues are added/tracked/fixed - we will commit a latex errata doc to this repo, and create pdfs in the releases section. Please help make future versions of this text better.
